in the code i upload
its about data rental_info.csv
figure out how many days a customer will rent a DVD
i used 2 models linearRegressor & RandomForest 
after converting the datetime features 
then Splitting the ['special_features'] column
then .drop unneed columns 
then splitting the data into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
I performed lasso Regression (it helps to find the best features)
then build the LinearRegressor model find out the Mean Sequared Error 
Then the fun time The RandomForestRegressor Model
to build a better model i performed CrossValidation: RandomizedSearchCV() to find the best_params_
used them in the RandomForestRegressor() to get a hieghr mse with 2.4
