in the code I upload

It's about data rental_info.csv.

figure out how many days a customer will rent a DVD

i used 2 models linearRegressor & RandomForest 

after converting the datetime features 

then splitting the ['special_features'] column

then .drop unneeded columns 

then splitting the data into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

I performed Lasso Regression (it helps to find the best features).

Then build the LinearRegressor model to find out the Mean Squared Error. 

Then the fun time The RandomForestRegressor Model

To build a better model, I performed CrossValidation: RandomizedSearchCV() to find the best_params_

used them in the RandomForestRegressor() to get a higher MSE with 2.4
